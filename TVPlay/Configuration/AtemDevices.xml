  *** Blackmagic Design ATEM plugin (TAS.Server.Atem.dll) configuration file ***

  This plugin serves three purposes:
  1. To switch inputs for "live" rundown events, allowing to preselect source for CasparCG video input.
     When "Live" event is about to start, the plugin will switch the ATEM input to the source selected in the event properties.
     Required configuration for the role is like this:

     <AtemDevice EngineName="TVP Szczecin" Address="192.168.2.9" InputSelectME="1" SwitchOnLoad="true"/>

  2. To switch inputs for "live" rundown events, allowing to select switcher source other than CasparCG output.
     When "Live" event is started, the plugin will switch the ATEM input to the source selected in the event properties.
     Additional delay may be configured, to allow for CasparCG buffer to be displayed before switching.
     Required configuration for the role is like this, assuming the CasparCG buffer is 6 frames (240 ms for 50i):

     <AtemDevice EngineName="TVP Szczecin" Address="192.168.2.9" InputSelectME="1" SwitchOnLoad="false" SwitchDelay="240"/>

  3. To start preloaded (parked) rundown item using the switcher - when PGM input is changed to specific source, the plugin will start the preloaded rundown item.

     To configure the role, use the configuration like this:

     <AtemDevice EngineName="TVP Szczecin" Address="192.168.2.9" StartME="1" StartVideoInput="1"/>

  You can combine two roles (e.g. second and third) in one configuration.
  In this case starting "live" rundown event will change Atem input to desired live source, then you can preload next runodwn item, which will start whem Atem input is changed.

  Configuration parameters:
  EngineName - name of the engine, *must be* the same string as EngineName in the engine configuration
  Address - IP address of the ATEM switcher
  InputSelectME - ME number to select input for "live" events, starting from 1 (ME1 = 1, ME2 = 2, etc.)
  StartME - ME number on which video source selection triggers playout start, counting from 1
  StartVideoInput - video input which selection triggers playout start, counting from 1 (0 = black, 1 = input 1, 2 = input 2, etc.)
  SwitchOnPreload - if true, the plugin will switch the input on live input load/preload (2 seconds in advance), if false, the plugin will switch the input on live input start, applying the delay
  SwitchDelay - delay in milliseconds to apply when switching the input on live input start
