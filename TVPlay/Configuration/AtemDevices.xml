  *** Blackmagic Design ATEM plugin (TAS.Server.Atem.dll) configuration file ***
  
  This plugin serves two purposes:
  1. To switch inputs for "live" rundown events, allowing to preselect source for CasparCG video input. 
     When "Live" event is about to start, the plugin will switch the ATEM input to the source selected in the event properties.
     Required configuration for the role is like this:

     <AtemDevice EngineName="TVP Szczecin" Address="192.168.2.9" InputSelectME="1"/>

  2. To start preloaded (parked) rundown item using the switcher - when PGM input is changed to specific source, the plugin will start the preloaded rundown item.

     To configure the role, use the configuration like this:

     <AtemDevice EngineName="TVP Szczecin" Address="192.168.2.9" StartME="1" StartVideoInput="1"/>

  You can combine both roles in one configuration, which may be useful if you have switcher with 2 or more MEs.

  Configuration parameters:
  EngineName - name of the engine, *must be* the same string as EngineName in the engine configuration
  Address - IP address of the ATEM switcher
  InputSelectME - ME number to select input for "live" events, starting from 1 (ME1 = 1, ME2 = 2, etc.)
  StartME - ME number on which video source selection triggers playout start, counting from 1
  StartVideoInput - video input which selection triggers playout start, counting from 1 (0 = black, 1 = input 1, 2 = input 2, etc.)
-->
  <AtemDevice EngineName="TVP Szczecin" Address="192.168.2.9" InputSelectME="1" StartME="2" StartVideoInput="1"/>
