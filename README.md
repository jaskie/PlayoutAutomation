# Open Playout Automation
Open Playout Automation is television broadcast solution. It is in development in Polish national television broadcaster - TVP (Telewizja Polska) and works as main MCR play-out system in its regional channels. Project uses SVT's [CasparCG] as clip player. It also intensively uses [FFmpeg] as media information and transcoding tool. 
It can be used as a simple (even multi-) channel-in-a-box solution, as well as in much more sophisticated environment (e.g. 2 players and control workstation with additional stuff, as GPI controlled devices).
